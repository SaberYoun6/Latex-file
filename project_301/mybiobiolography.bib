	abstract = {Background: Previously, small studies have found that BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast tumors differ in their pathology. Analysis of larger datasets of mutation carriers should allow further tumor characterization. Methods: We used data from 4,325 BRCA1 and 2,568 BRCA2 mutation carriers to analyze the pathology of invasive breast, ovarian, and contralateral breast cancers. Results: There was strong evidence that the proportion of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast tumors decreased with age at diagnosis among BRCA1 (P-trend = 1.2 {\texttimes} 10-5), but increased with age at diagnosis among BRCA2, carriers (P-trend = 6.8 {\texttimes} 10-6). The proportion of triple-negative tumors decreased with age at diagnosis in BRCA1 carriers but increased with age at diagnosis of BRCA2 carriers. In both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, ER-negative tumors were of higher histologic grade than ER-positive tumors (grade 3 vs. grade 1; P = 1.2 {\texttimes} 10-13 for BRCA1 and P = 0.001 for BRCA2). ER and progesterone receptor (PR) expression were independently associated with mutation carrier status [ER-positive odds ratio (OR) for BRCA2 = 9.4, 95\% CI: 7.0{\textendash}12.6 and PR-positive OR = 1.7, 95\% CI: 1.3{\textendash}2.3, under joint analysis]. Lobular tumors were more likely to be BRCA2-related (OR for BRCA2 = 3.3, 95\% CI: 2.4{\textendash}4.4; P = 4.4 {\texttimes} 10-14), and medullary tumors BRCA1-related (OR for BRCA2 = 0.25, 95\% CI: 0.18{\textendash}0.35; P = 2.3 {\texttimes} 10-15). ER-status of the first breast cancer was predictive of ER-status of asynchronous contralateral breast cancer (P = 0.0004 for BRCA1; P = 0.002 for BRCA2). There were no significant differences in ovarian cancer morphology between BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers (serous: 67\%; mucinous: 1\%; endometrioid: 12\%; clear-cell: 2\%). Conclusions/Impact: Pathologic characteristics of BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors may be useful for improving risk-prediction algorithms and informing clinical strategies for screening and prophylaxis.

Abstract = {We analysed primary breast cancers by genomic DNA copy number arrays, DNA methylation, exome sequencing, messenger RNA arrays, microRNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/},

abstract = "CONTEXT: As the availability of and demand for genetic testing for hereditary cancers increases in primary care and other clinical settings, alternative or adjunct educational methods to traditional genetic counseling will be needed. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a computer-based decision aid with standard genetic counseling for educating women about BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted from May 2000 to September 2002. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Outpatient clinics offering cancer genetic counseling at 6 US medical centers enrolled 211 women with personal or family histories of breast cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Standard one- on-one genetic counseling (n = 105) or education by a computer program followed by genetic counseling (n = 106). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants' knowledge, risk perception, intention to undergo genetic testing, decisional conflict, satisfaction with decision, anxiety, and satisfaction with the intervention. Counselor group measures were administered at baseline and after counseling. Computer group measures were administered at baseline, after computer use, and after counseling. Testing decisions were assessed at 1 and 6 months. Outcomes were analyzed by high vs low risk of carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. RESULTS: Both groups had comparable demographics, prior computer experience, medical literacy, and baseline knowledge of breast cancer and genetic testing, and both counseling and computer use were rated highly. Knowledge scores increased in both groups (P<.001) regardless of risk status, and change in knowledge was greater in the computer group compared with the counselor group (P = .03) among women at low risk of carrying a mutation. Perception of absolute risk of breast cancer decreased significantly after either intervention among all participants. Intention to undergo testing decreased significantly after either intervention among low-risk but not high- risk women. The counselor group had lower mean scores on a decisional conflict scale (P = .04) and, in low-risk women, higher mean scores on a satisfaction- with-decision scale (P = .001). Mean state anxiety scores were reduced by counseling but were within normal ranges for both groups at baseline and after either intervention, regardless of risk status. CONCLUSIONS: An interactive computer program was more effective than standard genetic counseling for increasing knowledge of breast cancer and genetic testing among women at low risk of carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. However, genetic counseling was more effective than the computer at reducing women's anxiety and facilitating more accurate risk perceptions. These results suggest that this computer program has the potential to stand alone as an educational intervention for low-risk women but should be used as a supplement to genetic counseling for those at high risk.",

abstract = "The increased risk of breast cancer in women with family history of breast cancer (FHBC) might be reduced by early childbirths. However, childbirth induces a transient increase in risk in the first 5-10 years, which coincides with the relatively increased risk of family cases at a young age. The objective was to investigate this short-term change in risk according to FHBC. We used a population-based cohort of 1.5 million Danish women. Between 1968 and 1990, 2770 incident cases of breast cancer below 40 years of age were identified in the Danish Cancer Register, of whom 276 (10%) had a FHBC. The first 5 years after a birth the short-term increase in risk was 30% (3-64%) larger in women with FHBC than without FHBC. After the first 5 years we observed no difference in the effect of a birth between women with and without FHBC. The adverse short-term effect of childbirthis stronger in women with FHBC.",
